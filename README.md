#Float
----------------
#Block elements always appeared vertically one after another, effectively limiting us to a single-column layout.

#“Floats” let you put block-level elements side-by-side instead of on top of each other. This is a big deal. It lets us build all sorts of layouts, including sidebars, multi-column pages, grids, and magazine-style articles with text flowing around an image. This is where we finally start creating real web pages.
note: Float-based layouts have mostly been replaced with Flexbox in modern 
#Left Align     #Center Align       #Right Align
float:left       margin:0 auto;       float:right;
